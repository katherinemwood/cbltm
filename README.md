This repo contains the code needed to run the six experiments in [Wood & Simons, 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13414-016-1240-2), as well as reproduce the analyses.

Both the experiment code and the analysis code have been refactored and condensed in order to be more suitable as a reference, as well as to make the experiment code compatible with Psychopy3. To see the materials as they were originally used in the study or to find more information, please [visit the OSF page for this research.](https://osf.io/6y35t/)
